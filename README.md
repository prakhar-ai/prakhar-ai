When compared to other python web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium, the lxml package gives an advantage in terms of performance. Reading and writing large XML files takes an indiscernible amount of time, making data processing easier &amp; much faster. - Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:10:56 +0530
